## ðŸš€ Key Topics and Skills Covered

### Database Fundamentals
* **Primary Key:** A unique identifier for each record in a table, ensuring no duplicates.
* **Secondary Key (or Alternate Key):** A candidate key not chosen as the primary key.
* **Foreign Key:** A reference to a primary key in another table, used to link tables and maintain **referential integrity**.
* **Database Relationships:**
    * **One-to-One:** A single record in one table is linked to a single record in another (e.g., a person and their passport).
    * **One-to-Many:** A single record in one table can be linked to multiple records in another (e.g., a customer and their orders).
    * **Many-to-Many:** Multiple records in one table can be linked to multiple records in another (e.g., students and courses), often requiring a **join table** to model the relationship.

### Relational vs. Non-Relational Databases
* **Relational Databases (SQL):** Store data in structured tables with rows and columns. They are ideal for structured data with clear relationships, such as customer records. Examples include MySQL.
* **Non-Relational Databases (NoSQL):** Store data in flexible formats like documents, key-value pairs, or graphs. They are better suited for **unstructured or semi-structured data** like social media posts or user profiles. An example is MongoDB.

### SQL Commands and Queries
The workbook provides practical examples of SQL queries for common data tasks, including:
* **`SELECT`:** Retrieving data from tables, including specific columns (`SELECT Name`) and counting records (`SELECT COUNT(*)`).
* **`FROM`:** Specifying the table to query (`FROM City`).
* **`WHERE`:** Filtering data based on a condition (`WHERE Population > 2000000`).
* **`ORDER BY`:** Sorting results in ascending (`ASC`) or descending (`DESC`) order.
* **`LIMIT` and `OFFSET`:** Limiting the number of results and specifying a starting point for retrieval.
* **`JOIN`:** Combining rows from two or more tables based on a related column, essential for linking entities like countries and their capital cities.
* **`GROUP BY` and `AVG()`:** Grouping data and calculating aggregate values, such as the average population per country.
* **`INSERT` and `CREATE TABLE`:** Commands for populating and defining the structure of a database and its tables.
