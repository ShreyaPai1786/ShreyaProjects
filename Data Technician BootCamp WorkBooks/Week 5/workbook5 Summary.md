## üìÖ Day 1: Cloud Fundamentals ‚òÅÔ∏è

This section introduces the foundational concepts of **cloud computing**. It explores what cloud computing is, its benefits for businesses, and the alternative of on-premises computing.

* **Cloud Providers**: A comparison of major cloud providers, including **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**, **Microsoft Azure**, and **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**, highlighting their key features and best use cases.
* **Cloud Service Models**: An overview of the three main cloud service models:
    * **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**: Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet, like virtual servers and storage.
    * **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**: Offers a ready-to-use platform for developing and deploying applications without managing the underlying infrastructure.
    * **SaaS (Software as a Service)**: Delivers software applications over the internet, accessible via a browser.
* **Cloud Deployment Models**: Definitions and real-world examples of different cloud environments:
    * **Public Cloud**: Shared resources owned by a third-party provider.
    * **Private Cloud**: Exclusive to a single organization, providing greater control.
    * **Hybrid Cloud**: Combines public and private clouds for flexibility.
    * **Community Cloud**: Shared among multiple organizations with similar goals or regulations.
* **Pricing**: Exercises on using Microsoft Azure's pricing and total cost of ownership (TCO) calculators to estimate cloud costs.

## üìú Day 2: Data Laws and Regulations ‚öñÔ∏è

This part of the workbook focuses on the legal and ethical aspects of handling data.

* **Computer Misuse Act 1990**: Covers three major offenses: unauthorized access to computer systems, unauthorized access with intent to commit further crimes, and unauthorized modification of computer material.
* **Police and Justice Act 2006**: Describes new powers added to the Computer Misuse Act, such as criminalizing denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and increasing penalties for cybercrime.
* **Data Protection**: Explores employee data an employer can legally store and data requiring an employee's permission, such as health information and biometric data.
* **Intellectual Property**: Defines and provides examples of **copyright infringement** and **plagiarism**, outlining the consequences of software piracy, including legal risks and exposure to malware.

## üìä Day 3: Data Exploration in Azure üñ•Ô∏è

This section includes practical labs exploring data in Microsoft Azure's environment.

* **Relational Data**: A lab on exploring relational data in Azure, likely using a service like **Azure SQL Database**. The document provides examples of SQL queries used to analyze a fictional database, including:
    * Filtering data using `WHERE` and `LIKE`.
    * Aggregating data with `COUNT`, `AVG`, and `SUM`.
    * Joining tables using `JOIN`.
    * Grouping and ordering results with `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY`.

## üìà Day 4: Data Engineering and Analytics ‚öôÔ∏è

The final day covers more advanced data tasks, including data integration and analytics using Microsoft Fabric.

* **Microsoft Fabric**: A lab that includes exercises using Microsoft Fabric to perform data engineering and analysis tasks. The included visuals show data pipelines, SQL queries, and data visualizations, suggesting a focus on:
    * Data ingestion and transformation with **Data Factory**.
    * Data querying and analysis using **SQL**.
    * Data visualization and reporting with **Power BI**.

* **Practice Exam**: Completion of a practice exam for the **Microsoft Azure Data Fundamentals (DP-900)** certification, showcasing a score and performance breakdown by section.
* **Optional Scenario**: A detailed report proposal for a fictional company, "Paws & Whiskers," outlining a data migration and analytics strategy on Azure. The report covers:
    * Relevant data laws and regulations (GDPR, DPA 2018).
    * Recommended Azure services for data storage, analysis, and integration.
    * Data types, modeling, and security considerations.
    * Additional recommendations for backup, disaster recovery, and data visualization with Power BI.
